        <h2>How do we make an impact?</h2>
        <h4>We are currently focusing our efforts on the high school and collegiate level, educating young adults so they can go off into the world and help those younger than them. To do this, we create SFFL chapters in all participating schools throughout the world.</h4>
        <br>
        <h4>We are hoping to spread our chapters throughout the entire United States as well as throughout the whole world. Because of our belief that financial literacy should be for everyone, we are willing to help anyone, regardless of knowledge, start a SFFL chapter. </h4>

        <h3>Our philosophy is to provide the framework for our chapters to be successful while still giving them the freedom to teach what is most relevant to their students. This stance reflects the nature of financial literacy as a whole: it is completely up to the individual. Most of all, our chapters serve the important role of raising awareness of the importance of financial literacy.</h3>

        <h2>Our Story.</h2>
        <h4>We were created by students who want to make an impact.</h4>
        <h4>We were high school students interested in economics and business. While looking for organizations to join, we noticed that there were organizations such as FBLA and DECA that covered key skills required to be successful in business. However, we couldn't find any organizations related to our interests that were able to make an impact in their community. We heard a lot of talk about the importance of financial literacy for high schoolers, but couldn't find any action. We decided to do something about this, and thus Students for Financial Literacy was born. </h4>
        <h4>Many students say that school does not prepare them for the real world; a common statement made is that schools do not teach students how to invest for the future, manage budgets, or understand debt. Although some schools are finally acknowledging this issue and offering financial literacy classes, many students are unable to take these necessary classes due to scheduling conflicts. We noticed that a lot of students were very interested in learning about financial literacy but either did not have the option to take a class or were not able to fit a class into their schedule. Our organization seeks to make this available for everyone, so our chapters normally meet before or after school. Our chapters are not just involved at their schools, however: they are often involved at local libraries and youth groups as well.</h4>
        <h4>What started as an idea has morphed into an organization that is able to affect hundreds of students. Students for Financial Literacy is not just for a specific group of people: it is for everyone.</h4>
