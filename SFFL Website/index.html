        <h1>We are Students for Financial Literacy</h1>
        <br>
        <h4>We noticed a problem. Our generation is suffering from the lack of financial literacy education in our primary schools, high schools, and even colleges. We have seen the damage that financial illiteracy has caused other generations, so we decided to do something about it.</h4>
      </div>

        <h3>Our Mission: to engage, educate, and empower young adults by helping all individuals pursue financial literacy regardless of background or socioeconomic status, leading to a financially secure future. </h3>

        <br>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-3 col-xs-12">
            <h4>We engage.</h4>
            <p>We believe that it is crucial to make financial literacy not just something that we all should know, but rather something that is exciting to learn. We engage young adults through the promotion of the benefits of financially sound decisions. We spread the news of the importance of financial literacy in areas where they are normally heard. Our goal is to make financial literacy something to talk about. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-3 col-xs-12">
            <h4>We educate.</h4>
            <p>We do more than just teach the basics of financial literacy: we dive deep into topics that young adults are most interested in as they move on to the next chapter of their lives. Each chapter of our organization has the ability to teach on the topics that their members are most interested in- we simply provide the framework. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-3 col-xs-12">
            <h4>We encourage.</h4>
            <p>Especially for those who know very little about financial literacy or feel that financial security is an almost impossible task, we strive to provide support in any way possible. We understand the difficulty in making financially sound decisions in todayâ€™s society and we use these challenges in our teaching. Our goal is to provide a community that supports and motivates each other for a brighter future. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-3 col-xs-12">
            <h4>We empower.</h4>
            <p>We believe that our generation and the generations prior have been taken advantage of. The lack of financial education and support for students has resulted in record levels of student debt as well as numerous other issues including poverty and unemployment. We seek to empower students, as well as all other individuals, through financial literacy. </p>
